# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Retail-Data-Python-

This project is a deep dive into a real-world retail dataset using Python. It was completed as part of a Coursera Guided Project titled ‚ÄúPerform Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Data with Python.‚Äù

The goal was to explore customer behavior, identify trends, and extract actionable insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.

# The Dataset üìä

The online retail store, 2010-11 December to December

InvoiceNo: Unique ID for each transaction

StockCode: Product identifier

Description: Product name

Quantity: Number of items purchased

InvoiceDate: Date and time of purchase

UnitPrice: Price per item

CustomerID: Unique customer ID

Country: Customer location

# The tools/ Libraries 
I decided to use my own environment not the provided online lab, for easy access.

Python 3

Pandas, for data manipulation

NumPy, for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn, for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook, for an interactive environment

# üìå Goals of the project

Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis

Perform descriptive statistics to understand data trends

Visualize key patterns and relationships

Derive insights to help improve business decisions

# üí° What data tells me

The UK accounts for the majority of sales.

Some products were frequently bought in bulk‚Äîindicating possible resellers or wholesale customers.

Months like November made higher sales, possibly due to holiday shopping.

Most inexpensive products are bought in bulks.
